 Many countries are affected by the graffitis and various arts by the people on the walls. For which if the wall is private owners refuse to get 
  it fixed, which is eventually charged by the government as a penalty.

  Now this is many a times paid but most of the times not paid by the owner of that wall.

  So, this code deals with the same, based upon the previous instances and many features it allows us to predict the probability whether the 
  test users would pay thier fines or not.

  This question was the final project of the course Applied ML in Python, so based on the dataset given to me , I chosed best 2 features to train and
  get the required roc_auc score.

  Also their are various plots in the end to depict its accuracy in the end.

  As the final output the function predicts the probability of the test users given in a different datasets and returns its in form of a series
